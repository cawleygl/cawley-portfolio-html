## Description of Application
This application is a portfolio of my personal coding projects. I used Boostrap CSS to design a webpage showcasing my best coding projects so far. It includes three pages, an "About Me" page with a profile picture and short biography, a "Contact" page with input fields to leave a name, email address, and message, and a "Portfolio" page with images of each project. The application includes a responsive navbar that utilizes a hamburger icon on smaller screens, and responsive containers that adjust to smaller screen sizes as well. I committed the code in several iterations as I went along as well, showcasing my progress along the way.
